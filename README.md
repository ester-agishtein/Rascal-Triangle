**The Rascal Triangle**

This program aims to solve the [Rascal Triangle problem]("http://acmgnyr.org/year2011/b.pdf") from the 2011 ACM Greater New York Programming Contest. 
Rascal's Triangle rows are numbered from the top starting with 0.   
Each row contains n+1 numbers indexed from 0 to n.   
The problem asks the programmer to find what the value at a specified row and index will be.  

This code uses the formula explained in [this article](https://apfstatic.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/08_comac_rascal_triangle.pdf) published by the Community of Mathematics Centre.
